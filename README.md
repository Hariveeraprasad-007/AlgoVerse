# 🌍 AlgoVerse – A Simulation & Problem-Solving Platform (Java)

AlgoVerse is a **multi-purpose problem-solving platform** that brings together **100% of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** into one project.  
It is designed as a **simulation-based system** where each real-world feature internally demonstrates different algorithms and data structures.
